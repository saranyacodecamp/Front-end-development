        <!-- Early Life and Family -->
        <h3>Early Life and Family</h3> 
        <p>Ilaiyaraaja was born as <i>Gnanathesikan</i> in 1943 in a normal middle-class family in <i>Pannaipuram, Theni district</i>, Tamil Nadu, India.
            When he joined the school his father changed his name as "Rajaiya" but his village people used to call him as "Raasayya".
            Ilaiyaraaja joined Dhanraj Master as a student to learn musical instruments and the master renamed and called him as just <i>"Raaja"</i>.
            In his first movie Annakili, Tamil film producer Panchu Arunachalam added "Ilaiya" (Ilaiya means younger in Tamil language) as 
            prefix in his name Raaja and he named as "Ilaiyaraaja" because in the 1970s there was one more music director A. M. Rajah who was 
            a popular one.<br>                
            Ilaiyaraaja was married to <i>Jeeva</i> and the couple have three children—Karthik Raja, Yuvan Shankar Raja and Bhavatharini—all
            film composers and singers. His wife Jeeva died on 31 October 2011.Ilaiyaraaja has a brother <i>Gangai Amaran</i>, 
            who is also a music director and lyricist in Tamil film industry.</p><br>

        <!-- Musical Style -->
        <h3>His Musical Style</h3>
        <p>Ilaiyaraaja's music is characterised by the use of an orchestration technique that is a synthesis of Western and Indian instruments
            and musical modes. He uses electronic music technology that integrates synthesizers, electric guitars and keyboards, drum machines,
            rhythm boxes and MIDI with large orchestras that feature traditional instruments such as the <i>veena, venu, nadaswaram, dholak, 
            mridangam and tabla</i> as well as Western lead instruments such as <i>saxophones and flutes</i>.<br>
            The basslines in his songs tend to be melodically dynamic, rising and falling in a dramatic fashion. Polyrhythms are also apparent,
            particularly in songs with Indian folk or Carnatic influences. The melodic structure of his songs demand considerable vocal
            virtuosity, and have found expressive platform amongst some of India's respected vocalists and playback singers, such as <i>Rajkumar,
            T. M. Soundararajan, K. J. Yesudas, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, S. Janaki, P. Susheela, Asha Bhosle, Lata Mangeshkar, Jayachandran, 
            S. P. Sailaja, Jency, Swarnalatha, K. S. Chithra, Minmini, Sujatha, Malaysia Vasudevan, Kavita Krishnamurthy, Hariharan, 
            Udit Narayan, Sadhana Sargam and Shreya Ghoshal</i>. Ilaiyaraaja has sung over 400 of his own compositions for films, and is 
            recognisable by his stark, deep voice. He has penned the lyrics for some of his songs in Tamil.</p><br>
