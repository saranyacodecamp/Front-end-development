    <h1 align="center">HTML BASICS</h1><br>

    <p>Welcome to HTML Basics. This page gives you the basics of Hyper Text Markup Language
    (HTML). HTML is the building block for web pages. It is used to tell your browser how to display the 
    webpages you visit. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, 
    different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
    The enclosing tags can make a word or an image a hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words,
    and can make font bigger or smaller, and so on. </p>

    <h2>A SAMPLE HTML DOCUMENT </h2>

    <img src="https://s.hswstatic.com/gif/html5-2.jpg" alt="Sample HTML Document">
    <p>Now lets look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. </p>
    <p><b>DOCTYPE html</b> — the doctype. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (about 1991/2), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set
         of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things.
         However, these days no one really cares about them, and they are really just a historical artifact that needs to be included for
          everything to work right.
    </p>
    <p><b>html</b> — the html element is known as the root element and it defines the HTML document.</p>
    <p><b>head</b> — the head element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content
         you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in 
         search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</p>
    <p><b>title</b> — the title element sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in.
         It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</p>
    <p><b>body</b> — the body element contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether
         that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</p><br>
        
    <h2>Basic HTML Tags </h2>
    <p><b><u>Heading Tags</u></b> - Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also has six levels
         of headings, which use the elements h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6. While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one
         line after that heading. h1 defines the largest and h6 defines the smallest.</p>

    <p><b><u>Paragraph Tag</u></b> - The P tag defines a Paragraph.Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and 
        after a paragraph.</p>

    <p><b><u>Line Breaks</u></b> - The br tag is used when you want to start a new line, but don't want to start a new paragraph. The
        tag forces a line break wherever you place it. It is similar to single spacing in a document.</p>

    <p><b><u>Lists</u></b> - A lot of the web's content is lists, and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consist of at
         least two elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:<br><br>
            <b>Unordered lists</b> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, like a shopping list. 
            These are wrapped in an ul element.<br>
            <b>Ordered lists</b> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, like a recipe. 
            These are wrapped in an ol element.<br><br>
            Each item inside the lists is put inside an li (list item) element</p>

    <p><b><u>Images</u></b>- Below shows the syntax for img tag<br><br>
        <img src="https://www.html-5-tutorial.com/images/image-tag.gif"> <br>
        <p>the img tag embeds an image into the page in the position it appears. the src (source) attribute contains the path to our image and the
            alt attribute specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image or Something has gone wrong causing the image to not display.</p>
    <p><b><u>Links</u></b></p> - HTML uses the anchor tag to create a link to another document or web page.An anchor can point to any resource
     on the Web: an HTML page, an image, a sound file, a movie, etc.<br>
    The syntax of creating an anchor: <br>

    <h2>Create your own HTML Page</h2>
    <p>It’s time to create your own page. Use your text editor to create a page which contains the following:<br><br>

      <ul>
      <li>the required HTML page codes</li>
      <li>link to another web page</li>
      <li>an email link</li>
      <li>a picture/graphic</li>
      <li>a list of information</li>
      </ul>
